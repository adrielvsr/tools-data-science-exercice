Exercise 2
This is the practical exercise to complete the course.
Exercise 3 - Introduction
We learned in this course about the most used tools for data science, being an interdisciplinary area that uses scientific methods to extract knowledge from data. Data science tools are programs that help scientists collect, clean, analyze and visualize data, tools such as: Model Asset Exchange (MAX); Jupyter notebooks; Anaconda and RStudio environments; Data visualization in R; IBM cloud-based environments; Google Contributor. These tools include programming languages ​​like R and Python, data analysis libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and data visualization platforms like Tableau and Power BI. These tools allow scientists to work with large datasets and perform complex analyzes to uncover hidden patterns and trends in the data.

Exercise 4 - Main languages ​​for data science.
Python: A high-level programming language widely used in data science due to its ease of use and the availability of data analysis libraries. A: A statistical programming language popular with statisticians and data scientists for its powerful data analysis and visualization tools. SQL: A structured query language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. Julia: A high-level programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing, with MATLAB-like syntax. MATLAB: A numerical programming language, widely used in engineering and physical sciences for mathematical modeling and data analysis.

Exercise 5 - Leading Data Science Libraries
Pandas: A Python library for data manipulation and analysis. NumPy: A Python library for scientific computing with support for multidimensional arrays. SciPy: A Python library for scientific and technical computing. Scikit-learn: A Python library for machine learning. Matplotlib: A Python library for creating visualizations.

Exercise 6 - Data Science tools table
Tool	Description
Python	High-level programming language for data science.
R	Statistical programming language for data analysis.
SQL	Query language for managing data in relational databases.
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive computing environment for creating documents with code and visualizations.
Tableau	Data visualization platform for creating interactive dashboards and reports.
Exercise 7 - Examples of arithmetic expression
In this exercise I will exemplify some examples of arithmetic expressions. Where, the basic arithmetic operators are addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/). Examples: 2 + 3 = 5, 4 - 1 = 3, 6 * 2 = 12, 8/4 = 2.

Exercise 8 - Example for multiplying and adding numbers
# Define the numbers to multiply and add
a = 2
b = 3
c = 4
​
# Multiply the numbers
result1 = a * b
​
# Add the numbers
result2 = a + b + c
​
# Print the results
print(f"The result of multiplying {a} and {b} is {result1}.")
print(f"The result of adding {a}, {b}, and {c} is {result2}.")
The result of multiplying 2 and 3 is 6.
The result of adding 2, 3, and 4 is 9.
Exercise 9 - Convert minutes to hours
400
# Define the number of minutes
minutes = 400
​
# Convert minutes to hours
hours = minutes / 60
​
# Print the result
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")
400 minutes is equal to 6.666666666666667 hours.
